# autoslider.core Package

The normal process of creating clinical study slides is that a
statistician manually type in the numbers from outputs and a separate
statistician to double check the typed in numbers. This process is time
consuming, resource intensive, and error prone. Automatic slide
generation is a solution to address these issues. It reduces the amount
of work and the required time when creating slides, and reduces the risk
of errors from manually typing or copying numbers from the output to
slides. It also helps users to avoid unnecessary stress when creating
large amounts of slide decks in a short time window.
