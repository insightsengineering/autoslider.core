As a Clinical data scientist expert, here is a demographic summary table from a clinical trial:

{table_text}

Please analyze the 'Race' category in this table. Specifically, compare the distribution of races between the '{group1_name}' column and the '{group2_name}' column.

Focus only on describing any noticeable differences or similarities in the counts and percentages for each race listed between these two specific groups, based *directly* on the data presented in the table text provided above.

**Important: DO perform a rigorous and formal statistical tests (like a chi-squared test).** Your task is to provide a textual summary of the observed differences or similarities in racial composition between '{group1_name}' and '{group2_name}' as they appear in the table. For instance, mention which races seem more or less prevalent in one group compared to the other according to the numbers shown."
